# kcal-counting-app
I wanted to do calories counting app using django &amp; drf
Basic functionalities of the app have been implemented:
- Authentication & authorization.
- User profile management.
- creating products.
- interactive dashboard in form of calendar.
- daily food consumption view with statistics pulled from backend.
- product modification/deletion from daily food consumption view.

What will be added in the future:
- My products view where you can find & update & delete your products.
- Recipes (and rating system).
- extensive statistics to track & forecast your goal advancements.
- maybe bar code scanner?

I have to drop this project now since I want to learn react to make it more professional. 
Once I feel confident enough I will go back to this project, rewrite it and deploy to production using AWS.
